"""Manipulation and interpolation of piecewise data/functions

The `piecewise` has some specialized routines for manipulation and
interpolation of piecewise data/functions.

.. warning::
   You may be better served using existing piecewise function functionality
   found in major math and science python packages such as `numpy` and
   `scipy`.  Use those more robust packages if at all possible.
