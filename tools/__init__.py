"""Utility scripts

The `tools` package contains some useful scripts for developing a python
package.  The scripts are not always documented well or do what they claim.
Originally developed for the `geotecha` package much of the
functinality is predicated on the following directory structure::

    <package-name>\
        <package-name>\
            <sub-package1>\
                __init__.py
                module1.py
                module2.py
                ...
            <sub_package2>
                __init__.py
                module_a.py
                module_b.py
                ...
            ...
            __init__.py
        <docs>\
        <tools>\
            __init__.py
            script1.py
            script1.py
        setup.py
